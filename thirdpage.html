		<p>Karzahni, Sadra and Idris. Again a 2007 set, and certainly a big one, in fact the biggest I ever had. Obviously, this set had 3 characters in it, all designed with great detail, especially karzahni, being the biggest in the set. I always admired the design of Karzahni, especially the cloak on his back. This set has a lot of play features, wonderful choice of characters and amazing builds made this set to be perceived as one of the best by Bionicle community.</p>

		<p2>This 2010 set pretty much represents the downfall of Bionicle, as it was a part of the last wave of sets before it got cancelled. This set comes as mediocre mainly due to its build, absence of play features and overall lack of originality. Basically you can describe any Bionicle set from 2010 with this statement. But it is worth mentioning that it was still god to see reappearance of Rahkshi, first time since 2003.</p2>
